      "taskTitle": "Implement OptimizationAdapter Core",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the OptimizationAdapter Core into 5 subtasks, focusing on: (1) adapter class structure and interface definition, (2) implementation of createOptimizedReader() method, (3) implementation of createOptimizedWriter() method, (4) implementation of enhanceFileOperations() method with fallback mechanisms, and (5) integration with Holocron optimization libraries from the specified path.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a core adapter pattern implementation that integrates with external optimization libraries. The complexity is high due to the need for backward compatibility, graceful fallbacks, and integration with external systems. Multiple methods need implementation with careful error handling."

      "taskTitle": "Develop StatusEnhancer Component",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the StatusEnhancer Component development into 4 subtasks, focusing on: (1) designing the StatusEnhancer class structure with proper interfaces, (2) implementing status mapping with emoji indicators, (3) developing the core methods (applyStatusStandards, formatTaskStatus, parseStatusInput), and (4) implementing status history tracking with getStatusHistory() method.",
      "reasoning": "This component requires careful handling of status formatting while maintaining backward compatibility. The emoji mapping and percentage tracking add complexity, but the scope is more contained than the core adapter. Multiple methods need implementation with data transformation logic."

      "taskTitle": "Build MemoryBridge Integration",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,

      "reasoning": "This task involves bidirectional synchronization between two complex systems, requiring careful state management, error handling, and non-blocking operations. The need for silent failures while maintaining core functionality adds significant complexity. Multiple synchronization methods with different data flows need implementation."

      "reasoning": "This system extends existing command handling capabilities while adding new ones, requiring careful integration to maintain backward compatibility. The validation logic, error messaging, and integration with multiple components (StatusEnhancer and MemoryBridge) increase complexity."

      "reasoning": "This component requires complex data visualization, graph rendering for dependencies, and real-time updates. The visual indicators for blockers and critical path analysis add significant complexity. The integration with the StatusEnhancer for proper status display also increases implementation difficulty."

      "reasoning": "This system involves complex knowledge representation, contextual retrieval, and integration with the MemoryBridge. The need for proper entity modeling and efficient retrieval mechanisms adds significant complexity. The system must handle various knowledge types and provide contextual relevance."
