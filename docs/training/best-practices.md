## Task Organization

### Effective Task Structure

- **Clear Titles**: Use concise, action-oriented titles (e.g., "Implement User Authentication" rather than "Auth")
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Include context, requirements, and acceptance criteria
- **Appropriate Granularity**: Tasks should be completable in 1-3 days; break larger tasks into subtasks
- **Consistent Formatting**: Maintain a consistent structure across all task descriptions

### Task Hierarchies

- **Use Subtasks**: Break complex tasks into manageable subtasks
- **Limit Nesting**: Avoid more than two levels of nesting to maintain clarity
- **Link Related Tasks**: Use dependencies for related tasks rather than deeply nested subtasks

### Tagging and Categorization

- **Consistent Tags**: Establish a standard set of tags (e.g., "frontend", "backend", "bug", "feature")
- **Priority Levels**: Use priority consistently (high, medium, low)
- **Component Labels**: Tag tasks with relevant system components

## Dependency Management

### Effective Dependencies

- **Minimal Dependencies**: Keep the dependency graph as simple as possible
- **Direct Dependencies**: Only create direct dependencies, not implied ones
- **Bidirectional Review**: When creating a dependency, review both source and target tasks

### Avoiding Dependency Issues

- **Prevent Cycles**: Regularly check for and resolve circular dependencies
- **Limit Fan-out**: A task should not block more than 3-5 other tasks
- **Validate Critical Paths**: Regularly review the critical path to ensure project timelines

### Dependency Visualization

- **Regular Graph Reviews**: Review the dependency graph weekly
- **Share Visualizations**: Include dependency graphs in team meetings
- **Path Analysis**: Analyze critical paths when planning sprints or iterations

## Status Tracking

### Status Workflow

- **Status Transitions**: Follow a consistent workflow (not-started → in-progress → under-review → done)
- **Blocked Status**: Use blocked status with a note explaining the blocker
- **Status Updates**: Update status at least daily when working on a task

### Status Standardization

- **Standard Statuses**: Stick to the standard status values for consistency
- **Status Aliases**: If needed, define aliases that map to standard statuses
- **Custom Statuses**: If you need custom statuses, document them clearly

### Status Reporting

- **Daily Updates**: Generate daily status reports for active projects
- **Completion Tracking**: Track completion percentages for larger initiatives
- **Status Dashboards**: Use dashboards to visualize project status

## Knowledge Capture

### When to Capture Knowledge

- **During Implementation**: Record insights while working on tasks
- **After Solving Problems**: Document solutions to difficult issues
- **Design Decisions**: Capture the reasoning behind important design choices
- **Team Discussions**: Record conclusions from architectural discussions

### Knowledge Structure

- **Contextual References**: Link knowledge to relevant tasks and components
- **Categorization**: Use consistent categories and tags for knowledge entries
- **Searchable Content**: Structure knowledge with searchable keywords and phrases

### Knowledge Retrieval

- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review captured knowledge for relevance
- **Reference in New Tasks**: Link to existing knowledge when creating related tasks
- **Team Sharing**: Share valuable insights during team meetings

## Performance Optimization

### When to Optimize

- **Enable Optimization**: Use the OptimizationAdapter for large projects
- **Batch Processing**: Use batch operations for bulk task updates
- **Resource Management**: Monitor and adjust resource usage for large operations

### Optimization Configuration

- **Task Reading**: Optimize task reading for faster dashboard loading
- **File Operations**: Use optimized file operations for large task files
- **Cache Settings**: Configure appropriate cache settings for your workflow

### Performance Monitoring

- **Collect Metrics**: Enable metrics collection for ongoing monitoring
- **Regular Reports**: Generate performance reports monthly
- **Bottleneck Analysis**: Identify and address performance bottlenecks

## Workflow Integration

### Version Control Integration

- **Task References**: Include task IDs in commit messages
- **Status Updates**: Update task status after related commits
- **Branch Naming**: Use task IDs in branch names for traceability

### CI/CD Integration

- **Automated Testing**: Link automated tests to relevant tasks
- **Deployment Tracking**: Update task status after successful deployments
- **Release Notes**: Generate release notes from completed tasks

### Project Management Integration

- **Two-way Sync**: Set up bidirectional synchronization with other tools
- **Status Mapping**: Ensure consistent status mapping between systems
- **Minimal Duplication**: Avoid duplicating information across systems

## Team Collaboration

### Task Assignment

- **Clear Ownership**: Assign a single owner to each task
- **Balanced Workloads**: Distribute tasks evenly across team members
- **Skill Matching**: Assign tasks based on team members' skills and interests

### Collaboration Workflow

- **Status Updates**: Update task status before team meetings
- **Blocker Resolution**: Promptly communicate and address blockers
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Share insights and learnings with the team

### Communication Practices

- **Task Comments**: Use task comments for relevant discussions
- **Decision Documentation**: Document important decisions in knowledge entries
- **Status Reporting**: Provide clear status updates in stand-up meetings

## System Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance

- **Task Cleanup**: Regularly archive completed tasks
- **Dependency Validation**: Periodically check for dependency issues
- **Database Optimization**: Optimize the task database monthly

### Backup and Recovery

- **Regular Backups**: Backup task data daily
- **Incremental Backups**: Use incremental backups for efficiency
- **Recovery Testing**: Test recovery procedures quarterly

### Upgrades and Updates

- **Version Updates**: Keep Task Master AI updated to the latest version
- **Compatibility Testing**: Test custom integrations after updates
- **Phased Rollouts**: Roll out major updates in phases

|---------|----------|----------|
| Too granular tasks | Excessive number of small tasks | Combine related micro-tasks |
| Too large tasks | Tasks remain in progress for weeks | Break into smaller, well-defined subtasks |
| Inconsistent status updates | Unclear project progress | Establish daily status update routine |
| Stale tasks | Tasks with no updates for weeks | Regular backlog grooming |

### Dependency Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptoms | Solution |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Circular dependencies | Tasks blocked in a loop | Use dependency validation; restructure tasks |
| Dependency explosion | Tasks with many dependencies | Simplify relationships; use parent tasks |
| Missing dependencies | Unexpected blockers | Regular dependency graph review |
| Overly rigid dependencies | Too many blocked tasks | Use softer dependency types when appropriate |

### Performance Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptoms | Solution |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Slow operations | Commands take too long | Enable optimizations; use batch operations |
